<h1> Comprehensive Framework and Software Designs for LLM Powered Healthcare Application <h1>
<h1> ENGR-5590G-Software-Engineering-Studio <h1>

<h3> This course features a team project allowing students to utilize the methods and tools they have learned in earlier courses to design and develop a large-scale software-intensive system. The projects are related to healthcare applications that utilize large language models. The project revolves around decomposing a large complex system into modules and classes that can be implemented, tested, deployed and maintained easily. <h3>

System Components:
<li> Frontend: Develop a user interface or dashboard using frameworks like Flask,
Laravel, or ASP.Net. <li>
<li> Backend: Implement server-side logic with appropriate languages and frameworks like
Python, Java, Node.js, or Django. <li>
<li> Database: Use databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB for data
management.<li>
<li> APIs: Design and implement RESTful APIs or GraphQL for data access and
manipulation. <li>
<li> CI/CD: Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI
for automated testing and deployment. <li>
<li> Cloud Deployment: Deploy the application and database on platforms like Microsoft
Azure, Google Cloud, or AWS. <li>
<li> Software Testing: Implement testing strategies, including unit testing, integration
testing, and end-to-end testing such as pytest, JUnit, or Selenium to ensure code quality
and reliability. <li>
<li> Large Language Models: Utilize LLM in your system to provide an extra feature to the system such as a chatbot <li>
